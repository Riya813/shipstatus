	  India will be a manufacturing hub for electric vehicles within the next five
	  years, adding that several countries do not want to deal with China after
	  the COVID-19 crisis, which can be an opportunity for India.” The Minister

	<br />Tesla will introduce their products in India and set up outlets. There
	are ongoing talks for a R&amp;D centre in Karnataka but a manufacturing
	facility is not part of the immidiate course of action. Cupertino, US-based
	Tesla is also likely to open retail outlets in other large cities in India
	depending on demand potential for its vehicles.<br />According to Karnataka
	Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa, “US carmaker Tesla will set up a car
	manufacturing unit in the state, and that an industrial corridor would be
	developed in Tumakuru, creating 2.8 Lac jobs.<br />In 2021-22, infrastructure
	development at a cost of Rs. 1.16 crore would take place in the state and Rs.
	14,788 crore would be released for the second phase of the Metro Rail work.
	The chief Minister said an industrial corridor would be developed in Tumakuru
	at an investment of Rs. 7,725 crore creating 2.8 lac jobs. Hailing the Union
	Budget presented recently as historic, Yediyurappa said it would pave the way
	for a $5 trillion economy by 2025.</span

	<p style="text-align: left"></p>
	<ul style="text-align: left">
	  <li>
		<span style="font-family: verdana"
		  ><i>Production Deadline</i>- This is by far the biggest hurdle. By
		  setting highly ambitious production goals, Elon Musk has succeeded in
		  making headlines and getting investors excited, but this also means that
		  is Tesla struggles to meet its goal of delivering 500,000 thousand
		  vehicles this year, it could be in trouble.</span

	  </li>
	</ul>
	<ul style="text-align: left">
	  <li>
		<span style="font-family: verdana"
		  ><i>Managing spending</i>- Tesla has burned through cash before and fast
		  - around $1 billion per quarter. True, a lot of this cash is invested in
		  potentially profitable projects such as the battery gigafactory, and
		  yet, this level of spending leaves the company in a tight spot.</span

	  </li>
	</ul>
	<ul style="text-align: left">
	  <li>
		<span style="font-family: verdana"
		  ><i>Keeping the personnel stable</i>- There have been major executive
		  walkouts from the company, including some members of the finance team.
		  There are also questions regarding Elon Musk’s ongoing role. This is not
		  something investors like to hear during challenging times.</span

	  </li>

	<ul style="text-align: left">
	  <li>
		<span style="font-family: verdana"
		  ><i>Dealing with competition</i>- Many of the leading brands in the auto
		  industry are finally investing big in electric vehicles. Tesla’s luxury
		  vehicles already face major competition from vehicles such as Chevy
		  Bolt, and when more affordable cars appear, the impact could be
		  substantial.</span
