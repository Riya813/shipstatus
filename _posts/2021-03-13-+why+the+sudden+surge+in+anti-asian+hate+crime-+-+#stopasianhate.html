      >In January 2021, an 84 year old Vicha Ratanapakdee was attacked in San
      Francisco while taking his morning walk. He died just two days after the
      attack due to injuries. A man attacked three people in Oakland’s
      Chinatown. A 91-year old man, 60-year old man and 55-year old woman were
      injured. A 55-year old Chinese woman was attacked near a bakery in New
      York City. Nearly 3000 reports of such violence have been reported since
      last year. These Anti-asian crimes were reported in 47 cities and
      districts of California. Exact number of crimes can’t be determined as no
      government or organisational agencies are working and tracking this
      issue.</span

      >There are over six million Asian Americans living in California. The city
      of California was badly impacted by COVID-19 which resulted in over 50,000
      deaths and economical distress. This might be the reason to intensify
      these hate crime cases against Asians. California congresswoman Judy Chu
      said, ” The Asian community has reached a crisis-point.” She further
      added, “These attacks are no accidents. It is clear January 6 was not the
      only violence Donald Trump incited.”&nbsp;</span

      >As the crimes are still increasing, certains actions are taken by the
      government in the United States. An executive order is signed by President
      Joe Biden denouncing Anti-Asian discrimination. Biden calls out the rise
      in hate crimes against Asians on public platforms. He said, “They are
      harassed, attached, blamed and scapegoated. They are forced to live in
      fear for their lives just walking down the streets in America. It’s wrong,
      it’s un-American and it must stop. Former president Bill Clinton has also
      talked about this issue. He said,”I Am deeply concerned about the hate
      crime targeting Asian Americans. We must speak out against discrimination
      of all kind, reject the ignorant rhetoric driving the waves of violence,
      and reach out to support people.”</span
